One function of the operating system is Memory Management. Memory management is the colelction of words or bytes, each of which have their own address. An OS will keep track of memory, what part is used by what address and allocates memory when processes requests it. It will also re-accocate the memory when a process ends or no longer needs the memory. 
Process management is when the Operating system decides which process or application gets access to use the processor and for how long. Processor management will use a program known as a traffic controller to keep track of the processor and the processes using it. Similar to the Memory management, the Processor management will provide CPU access to processes and remove access when the task is complete. 
File management is the organization of directories for simple navigation and easy usage. Directories can contain either files or sub-directories. The operating system tracks the location, status, and uses of various pieces of information in the system. This is known as a File system.
